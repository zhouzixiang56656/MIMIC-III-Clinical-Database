The Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring Database (MIMIC-III) is a free and open, public resource intensive care unit research database. The database was released in 2006 by the Computational Physiology Laboratory at MIT, along with Beth Israel Deacon Medical Center (BIDMC) and Philips Medical. The matched subset of the MIMIC-III waveform database contains 22,317 waveform records and 22,247 digital records for 10,282 different ICU patients. These recordings typically include digitized signals such as ECG, ABP, respiration, and PPG, as well as periodic measurements such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressure. This database is the MIMIC-III waveform database and represents the patient's identified records whose corresponding clinical records are in the MIMIC-III clinical database. Using all available information, through a process of mostly automatic matching and some manual correction, a total of 22 317 waveform records (34%) and 22 247 digital records (35%) were found that could be linked to the corresponding patients in the clinical database .
